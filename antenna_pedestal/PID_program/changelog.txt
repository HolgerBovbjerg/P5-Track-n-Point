NEW:
- Changed PID controllers to P controllers and lowered variables

MISSING:
- Properly calculating AoA (Get Error function)
- Changing the program to run on received error rather than simulated error
- Search function that rotates pedestal slowly at 45 degree incline to search for signal

ISSUES:
- "Init" still fails horizontal alignment roughly 1 out of 4 times by registering alignment prematurely
- PWM adjustment only works for pins not currently wired. (Doesn't make much difference anyway)
- PWM signals physically on wrong pins
- SPI signals physically on wrong pins
- Optional: Inputs for potentiometers on A0 and A1

OLD:
-------------------------------------------------------------------

NEW:
- Changed SPI pins in program
- Made Preliminary SPI function
- Made Preliminary AoA function

MISSING:
- Calculation of angle of arrival (Get Error function)
- Changing the program to run on received error rather than simulated error
- Search function that rotates pedestal slowly at 45 degree incline to search for signal

ISSUES:
- New stepper not tested along with the rest of the system
- "Init" still fails horizontal alignment roughly 1 out of 4 times by registering alignment prematurely
- "Init" not fully tested due to stepper mechanism not working
- Possibly issues running small motor and large motor simultaneously at less than 100% duty cycle (might work with 24 volt supply)
- PWM adjustment only works for pins not currently wired. Doesn't make much difference anyway
- Encoder counter not tested with stand
- Joystick not tested
- PWM signals physically on wrong pins
- SPI signals physically on wrong pins
- Optional: Inputs for joystick on A0 and A1

NEW:
- Implemented joystick for error (both horizontal and vertical)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
NEW:
- Integrated new stepper controller that was tested before assignment hand-in.
	- Sets stepper position based on sensed hall sensors
		- Removed counters for how many times hall sensors have been sensed (was used for testing).
		- Changed old variable names for hall sensors and removed obsolete variables.
		- Added initial states to hall sensor state tracker to avoid unintended effects.
	- Updated vertical error simulation 
		- Changed up a few variables names
	- Inserted the stepper controller code

ISSUES:
- New stepper not tested along with the rest of the system
- "Init" still fails horizontal alignment roughly 1 out of 4 times by registering alignment prematurely
- "Init" not fully tested due to stepper mechanism not working
- Possibly issues running small motor and large motor simultaneously at less than 100% duty cycle (might work with 24 volt supply)

- Encoder doesn't count properly

--------------------------------------------------------------------
NEW:
- Updated "Init" with stepper function.
- Trimmed down init to have checks in the main loop instead of in the function regarding whether or not to run "Init" 

ISSUES:
- "Init" still fails horizontal alignment roughly 1 out of 4 times by registering alignment prematurely
- "Init" not actually tested due to stepper mechanism not working
