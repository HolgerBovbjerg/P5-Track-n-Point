# P5-Track-n-Point
This repository contains material made for a 5th semester project on Aalborg University.

## Included material
The material includes vhdl files for a AoA estimation system implemented on an Altera Cyclone III FPGA. This includes an input register, a Goertzel DFT block, a phase calculator and an AoA estimator block.   

## Main focus
The main focus of the project is to track a drone and pointing at it. The drone is located by measuring the drones signal with three antennas and comparing their phase.
