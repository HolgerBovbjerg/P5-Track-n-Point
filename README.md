# P5-Track-n-Point
This repository contains material made for a 5th semester project on Aalborg University.
## Main focus
The main focus of the project is to track a drone and pointing at it. The drone is located by measuring the drones signal with three antennas and comparing their phase.  
## Included material
The material includes follwing
* VHDL files for a AoA estimation system implemented on an Altera Cyclone III FPGA. This includes an input register, a Goertzel DFT block, a phase calculator and an AoA estimator block.   
* Matlab scripts used for calculation and simulation of various things like antenna parameters, and algorithms.
* Arduino-C code for controlling an antenna pedestal
* Maple files used for various calculations.
* Antenna design files inlcuding CST simulation files and Altium files for manufacturing antenna on PCB.
* Various figures used in the report.
* Test data and test scripts used for various tests such as test of motor parameters.
